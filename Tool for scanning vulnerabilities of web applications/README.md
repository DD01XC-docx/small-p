# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This tool is designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities, including **SQL Injection**, **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**, and **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**. It helps security researchers and developers identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Features
- **XSS Detection**: Detects possible XSS vulnerabilities that could allow script injections.
- **SQL Injection**: Identifies potential SQL injection points where queries can be manipulated.
- **CSRF**: Scans for CSRF vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized actions.

   - Edit `config.py` to set the target URL for scanning.

2. **Running the Scanner**:
   To begin scanning, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python scanner.py
3. ""Results"": After the scan, results will be displayed in the terminal or saved in a report.
